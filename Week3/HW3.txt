Raspberry Pi:    Quad 64 Bit 1.2Ghz cpu   1GB SDRAM 1.4Ghz Gigabit ethernet "Over USB"; appears not native

Desktop might have 8+ cores, about twice as fast, but a lot more RAM.   Plus faster graphics.

Jetson TX2:   32G memory  Quad ARM (doesn't say speed) but 256 CUDA/Vector cores   (Much more memory than Raspberry Pi)

Why is blockchain important to IoT?

First, it provided a simple and moderately effective consensus algorithm, 
allowing nodes in the network to collectively agree on a set of canonical updates to the state
of the Bitcoin ledger. Second, it provided a mechanism for allowing free entry into the consensus process,
solving the political problem of deciding who gets to influence the consensus, while simultaneously preventing sybil attacks.

It does this by substituting a formal barrier to participation, such as the requirement
to be registered as a unique entity on a particular list, with an economic barrier - the weight of a single node in the
consensus voting process is directly proportional to the computing power that the node brings.

You let people enter, but don't give them much of a vote on things that matter.....
